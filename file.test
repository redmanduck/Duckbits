The total number of elements successfully written is returned.
If this number differs from the count parameter, a writing error prevented the function from completing. In this case, the error indicator (ferror) will be set for the stream.
If either size or count is zero, the function returns zero and the error indicator remains unchanged.
size_t is an unsigned integral type.
